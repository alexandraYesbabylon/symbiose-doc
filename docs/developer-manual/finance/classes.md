## Invoice

### getWorkflow

The workflow encapsulates a comprehensive definition for invoice management.
It delineates three distinct states: 'proforma', 'invoice', and 'cancelled'.
Within each state, defined transitions dictate permissible actions, such as transitioning from 'proforma' to 'invoice' upon completion or reverting to 'cancelled' status if needed.
