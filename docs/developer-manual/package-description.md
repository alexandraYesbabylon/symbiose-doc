# Packages 



## Structure

An application is divided in several parts, stored in a package folder located under the `/packages` directory.
Each package might contain the following folders (underlined folders are mandatory).

Each **package** is defined as follows :

```
package_name
├── classes
│   └── */*.class.php
├── actions
│   └── */*.php
├── apps
│   └── */*.php
├── data
│   └── */*.php
├── tests
│   └── */*.php
├── init
│   └── *.json
├── views

├── i18n
│   └── *

##### manifest.json

The manifest is a file containing informations about the package and its apps:

```

    apps: [
	    {    
	        name: string

# All the packages



## core

The core package is the starter pack of symbiose. Pretty much every other package uses the classes built in core, by extending (*reusing the classes built in core with their parameters and adding new parameters*), or considering that every other package is than lacking the classes initiated in core. 

A few examples of the classes initiated in core: 

- User.class.php
- Translation.class.php
- Permission.class.php
- etc.

Those classes appear necessary for the functioning of any website.

In conclusion, this package needs to be instantiated first and to achieve that, it uses an initiator controller : `core\actions\init\package`.  The controller has to parameters: `import`& `compile`, `import` ables the import of data (from the `init folder`) to the DB and `compile` ables the compilation of the package that will be moved to the `public` folder. 

Symbiose gives an instantiating order of the packages, this order can be found inside the `manifest.json` file, necessary to every package at the `depends_on` property.

Example from the `sale` package : 

```json
"depends_on": [
        "core",
        "identity",
        "finance"
]
```

In this example, the packages : `core, identity & finance` are instantiated before the `sale` package and in this order (every time one of these packages is instantiated, the controller looks at their own `manifest.json file`).
